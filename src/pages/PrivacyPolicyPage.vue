            The Irregular Verbs mobile app and its affiliated website, The Best
            Irregular Verbs, (together referred to as “the app”) is an app
            designed to help users learn and practice English irregular verbs.
            The app provides comprehensive lists of irregular verbs along with
            their past simple and past participle forms, translations, and
            exercises for practice. This privacy policy outlines the information
            that we collect and how we use it to improve the app user
            experience.

          <h5 class="q-my-sm text-subtitle1">Information Collected</h5>
          <p>
            The app collects anonymous usage data using Google Analytics. This
            data includes information such as app usage, page views, clicks, and
            other interactions with the app. We do not collect or share any
            personally identifiable information with third-party services.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also allow users to save a customized list of selected verbs,
            which is stored locally on their devices. We do not collect or share
            this data with third-party services.
          </p>
          <h5 class="q-my-sm text-subtitle1">Use of Information</h5>
          <p>
            We use the anonymous data collected through Google Analytics to
            improve the app and its features for a better user experience. The
            customized verb lists are solely used for the user’s convenience,
            and are not shared with third-party services.
